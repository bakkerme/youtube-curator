Today's vlog style video is all about some upgrades I recently did to my studio set. I ran an Ethernet cable from my router on the other side of the room, and got a network switch installed. This way, any computer that I take a look at can now have wired access to my network!

I was recently contacted by a former Microsoft Beta Tester who offered to send me some items in his collection. This is a set of Microsoft beta software from the '90s all the way to the late 2000s!
